# E-Portfolio-Docker
This is a repository for my e-portfolio which I held in the class 'software engineering'. This is used for university purposes. This repository includes a tutorial on how to set up Docker and a sample code.

## Install Docker

Docker is easy to install.
It runs on:
* A variety of Linux distributions.
* Natively on OS X.
* Natively on Microsoft Windows.

### Installing Docker on Mircosoft Windows and OS X

Docker runs natively on OS X and Microsoft Windows.
Therefore, you can download the Docker Community Edition (CE) apps Docker for Windows or Docker for Mac. Both install packages include everything you need to run Docker on a Windows or OS X system.

Download Links:

[Docker for Windows](https://download.docker.com/win/stable/InstallDocker.msi)

[Docker for Mac](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg)

If you face any troubles, please check out one of the following sites:

[Installation guide for OS X](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/#install-and-run-docker-for-mac)

### Installing Docker on Linux

It can be installed via:
* Distribution-supplied packages on virtually all distros. (Includes at least: Arch Linux, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo,openSUSE, RHEL, Ubuntu.)
* Packages supplied by Docker.
* Installation script from Docker.
* Binary download from Docker (it's a single file).

### Installing Docker on your Linux distribution

On Fedora:
$ sudo yum install docker-io

On CentOS 7:
$ sudo yum install docker

On Debian and derivatives
$ sudo apt-get install docker.io

### Installation Script from Docker

You can use the curl command to install on several platforms:

$ curl -s https://get.docker.com/ | sudo sh

This currently works on:
* Ubuntu
* Debian
* Fedora
* Gentoo
